# Why "Orchestration" appeared?

- The difference between automation and orchestration
- The basic knowledge about Orchestration is:
In a containers system, you want to manage all of them: Start, Finish, Update, Scale,...You can do one by one, but it wastes time and energy. Container Orchestration was born for solving this problem. The detail about it is complained as below.

## 1. Orchestration
" Orchestration extends lifecycle management capabilities to complex, multi-container workloads deployed on a cluster of machines"

- Orchestration helps:
    
     - Provisioning/ scheduling
     - Discovery
     - Health monitoring
     - Making rules and constraints

Besides, generally, container orchestration is:
Scheduling, Cluster management, Service discovery, Monitoring, Configuration management, Auto-Scaling, Networking, Load Balancing, ...

## 2. Orchestration Technologies
3 popular orchestration platforms:
     
     - Docker Swarm
     - Kubernetes
     - Apache Mesos

Besides, Ansible, SaltStack, HashiCorp Product, OpenShift, Puppet Labs, Rancher, Chef, ...

Every platform maybe strong at different functionality. Such as:

- Service discovery tools used for containers: Consul, Zookeeper, etcd, SkyDNS,...
- Scheduling: Kubernetes, Marathon, Docker Swarm, Chronos, Consul,...
- Cluster management: Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Google Container Engine, OpenShift, Mesos,...

## 3. Conclusion

Exactly, orchestration helps much for DevOps work/ CI.CD. It deserves more consideration. 

## the end.
